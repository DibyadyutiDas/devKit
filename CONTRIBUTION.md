## 📌 Guidelines

Please follow these best practices:

### 🔖 Naming
- Use clear, descriptive file names (`auto_git_push.sh`, not `script1.sh`)
- Folder names should be kebab-case or snake_case

### ✅ Code Style
- Use consistent formatting and comments.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness.

### 📝 Documentation
- Every script or boilerplate should include a comment block or `README.md` explaining:
  - What it does
  - How to use it
  - Required dependencies (if any)

### 🚦 Commits
- Write meaningful commit messages:
  - ✅ `feat: add React + Tailwind starter`
  - 🐛 `fix: correct mongo reset script`
  - 🧹 `refactor: clean up shell script formatting`
